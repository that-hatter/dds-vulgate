# dds-vulgate

An SQLite3 database for storing **Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Story Trading Card Game** cards.

## Download

You can download the SQLite3 file through **[this link](https://github.com/that-hatter/dds-vulgate/raw/master/dist/vulgate.db)**. You can also download an empty database **[here](https://github.com/that-hatter/dds-vulgate/raw/master/dist/vulgate_empty.db)**. Both of these files are available in the `dist` folder.

## Notice

The files in `src` are meant to extract info from **weaK_willO** and **Zweistar**'s translations [spreadsheet]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1omP3qkloKbA4GMdD9U9wQh_Gew0X8aNlR4LBTvTM6NA/edit#gid=0"). It stops when it reaches a card with missing info (aside from missing flavor, which it simply replaces with "Dummy Flavor"). This means the database is currently incomplete and will receive updates in sync with the translations.

## Card Pics

The card pics are simply resized and compressed versions of **weaK_willO**'s scans which can be found on his [Goodle Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dbi4zTUDymSQ1oHXO48RrVY173-iIZI9) and [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/7VcV1AqY#5kza3MASbtrI0F9tSftutg) folders. These are temporary, until someone makes generated hq pics.

## Documentation

_to be added; for now, you can ask Hatter#3283 in Discord for details_
