# dds-vulgate

An SQLite3 database for storing **Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Story Trading Card Game** cards.
**[Download](https://github.com/that-hatter/dds-vulgate/raw/master/dist/vulgate.db)**

## Notice

For now, the files in `src` are meant to extract info from **weaK_willO** and **Zweistar**'s translations [spreadsheet]("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1omP3qkloKbA4GMdD9U9wQh_Gew0X8aNlR4LBTvTM6NA/edit#gid=0"). It stops when it reaches a card with missing info (aside from missing flavor, which it simply replaces with "Dummy Flavor"). This means the database is currently incomplete and will receive updates in sync with the translations.

## Documentation

_to be added; for now, you can ask Hatter#0106 in Discord for details_
